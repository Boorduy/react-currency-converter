LETSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

ok basically values woyldnt change only currencies for several reasons. i realized that it doesnt change
because when we convert we are actually converting the whole thing and not the previous event.

so instead of 
const swap = () => {
        setAmount(0)
        setFrom(to)
      setTo(from)
        
        
    }

const convert = () => {
     setConvertedAmount(amount * currencyInfo[to])

     // I  FIXED   ITTTTT

    }
 i did this

    const convert = () => {
     setConvertedAmount( a => a * currencyInfo[to])

     // I  FFIXEXEXEEDDD   ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

    //IT WAS THIS EASY MY BRRAIN DIED BUT I DID IT
      
      
    }

const swap = () => {
        const amountA = amount
        const amountB = convertedAmount
        setConvertedAmount(amountA)
        setAmount(amountB)
        setFrom(to)
      setTo(from)
        
        
    }
    nvm the calculation got messed up
